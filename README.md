Included in this package:

	1.	R code to generate analyses and figures in the piece - analysis_HT_20180326.R

Please note that the file path needs to be changed in the code to match with the location of the dataset on your computer.
The columns of the dataset coding moveable/immoveable wealth, education and major criminal cases are provided from candidate affidavits by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). I thank Milan Vaishnav for providing me with a web-scraped version of the ADR data. All of the electoral data is provided by Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) at Ashoka University.
The variable titles should be self-explanatory.
