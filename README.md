Included in this package:

<ol>
<li> R code to generate analyses and figures in the piece  - analysis_HT_20180326.R </li>
<li> The dataset - Renomination20092014.csv </li>
</ol>

The columns of the dataset coding moveable/immoveable wealth, education and major criminal cases are provided from candidate affidavits by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). I thank Milan Vaishnav for providing me with a web-scraped version of the ADR data. All of the electoral data is provided by Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) at Ashoka University.

The variable titles should be self-explanatory.
